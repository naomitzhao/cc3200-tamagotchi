                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>Our project is the CC3200 Tamagotchi, a spin-off of the classic hand-held "Tamagotchi" game, in which a user
                    raises and plays minigames with a virtual pet. Using a TI CC3200 board connected to various inputs and
                    outputs, we created a device that displays the game state and visuals on an Adafruit OLED and shows warning
                    signals on an external LED. The game is controlled primarily by an IR TV remote and the on-board
                    accelerometer. TV signals are used as inputs in game navigation and minigames, and the accelerometer is used
                    in minigames.

                <h3>Main Screen</h3>
                <p>Gameplay is centered around a main screen that shows the virtual pet using an animated, stylized graphic of a
                    cat sitting in a box. Status bars are shown at the bottom, with blue corresponding to experience (XP), yellow
                    corresponding to hunger, and red corresponding to happiness. Hunger and happiness decrease over time, and must
                    be increased via the feeding or playing minigames to keep the pet from running away, as shown in Figures 2 and
                    3. XP can be increased by the training minigame, and at certain experience thresholds, the pet levels up. The
                    current level and XP are displayed on the game main screen above the status bars. At a certain level
                    threshold, which we set to level 4, the size of the pet increases, or scales up, showing growth of the pet.

                <h3>AWS Connection</h3>
                <p>
                    The CC3200 also connects to an AWS server via a SimpleLink WiFi connection. It modifies an AWS device shadow
                    thing that represents the current state of the pet. This AWS device shadow is used for saving the game and
                    loading existing saves on the CC3200. The information on the device shadow can also be accessed from a web
                    interface that displays the pet GIF, level, experience, and status bars, similarly to the OLED interface. The
                    web interface also features options to feed and play with the pet.

                <h3>Game Over and Warnings</h3>
                <p>
                    When hunger or happiness reaches 0, the pet will "run away", erasing its save data and showing a special
                    graphic on the screen. Before, then when hunger or happiness reaches 5 or lower, an attached LED will flash
                    periodically to remind the player to feed or play with the pet.

                <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                <p>
                    Although our project is based on the classic Tamagotchi handheld device, our rendition has some key differences
                    that makes it stand out. For one, our virtual pet game allows the user to have multiple pets at once, unlike
                    the original Tamagotchi, which only allows one. We implemented save and load mechanics via AWS, and added the
                    ability to have two saves at once. When the device starts, the user is prompted to create a new save or load a
                    save from either LOAD 1 or LOAD 2. Additionally, our virtual pet game uses cloud sync and has a web dashboard
                    thanks to the on-board WiFi connection and our AWS server. This allows the user to view and take care of their
                    pet even when the device is turned off. Finally, our implementation also uses AWS SNS to send email
                    notifications when of the pets' hunger or happiness reaches 5.
